PLG_FORCEPASSWORDCOMPLEXITY="System - FPC - Force Password Complexity"
PLG_FORCEPASSWORDCOMPLEXITY_XML_DESCRIPTION="<h2><strong>FPC - Force Password Complexity</strong></h2><p>The system plugin checks the user passwords using defined security patterns and rejects weak passwords. In this way FPC ensures stronger security of the whole system.</p><p>The settings of FPC are divided into two parts: Execution and Checks.</p><p>Under 'Execution' you may change the settings, how and where the plugin is executed. The application can be restricted to the front- and / or backend, on specific user groups and the status of the user. Additionally you may show a warning, to not specified users, that the entered password has been saved but it has been evaluated by the system to be insecure.</p><p>Under 'Checks' you may define individual check patterns to guarantee secure passwords. You may define a minimum length and entropy of the password.  Entropy is a measure of the uncertainty in a random variable. The higher the number, the better (more complex) the password. You have the ability to forbid parts of the name or the email address upon creation of the password. The options to restrict the maximum number of equivalent or consecutive characters avoid very weak passwords with few or repeating characters. Another important option is the ability to define which characters must be integrated at least once into the password. Here you have the options for upper- and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters (multiple selection is possible and recommended).</p><p>I wish you success in securing your site! Please support my work and the free availability of the extension with the purchase of a donation code if it brings an added value to your site.</p><p>Project page: <a href="_QQ_"https://joomla-extensions.kubik-rubik.de/fpc-force-password-complexity"_QQ_" target="_QQ_"_blank"_QQ_">Force Password Complexity</a></p><p>Please write a review in the JED: <a href="_QQ_"http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/extension/access-a-security/site-security/force-password-complexity"_QQ_" target="_QQ_"_blank"_QQ_" title="_QQ_"FPC - Force Password Complexity in the Joomla!
